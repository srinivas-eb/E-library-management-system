The e-library management system in C allows users to register, log in, and manage book
information. Users can list available books, add new ones, search by author, check total book
count, and manage book checkouts and returns. It supports functionalities to view previous
members, delete all book data (authorized access only), and handle memory allocation errors. The
program utilizes a linked list to maintain book records and supports basic operations like adding,
listing, and searching for books. Although functional, it would benefit from enhanced security
features for user credentials and improved memory management practices.
